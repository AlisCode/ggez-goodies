//! An abstract input state object that gets fed user
//! events and updates itself based on a set of key
//! bindings.
//! The idea is threefold:
//!
//! * Have a layer of abstract key bindings rather than
//! looking at concrete event types
//! * Use this to be able to abstract away differences
//! between keyboards, joysticks and game controllers
//! (rather based on Unity3D),
//! * Do some tweening of input axes and stuff just for
//! funs.
