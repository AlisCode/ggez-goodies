# ggez-goodies

Useful modules for the ggez Rust game framework.

Each module is meant to be pretty much self-contained without relying on the others.

# Modules that exist

Bupkis!  Hah!

# Modules to create

* Resource loader/cache
* Scene stack
* Particle system
* Input indirection layer and state tracking
* Sprites with ordering, animation, atlasing, tile mapping, 3x3 sprites...
* GUI
* Timers?
* In-game debugger...

# Useful goodies made by other people

* specs for entity-component system (alternatives: ecs or recs crates)
* cgmath or vecmath for math operations?
* physics/collision???
